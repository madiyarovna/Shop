## The goal of the project is to help users order things online, remotely. The site will allow people to choose things that have been automatically recommended for their age and preference and order them from anywhere in the world.

### Content
We have created 3 main classes that contain the most important information. The first class, user, consists of information such as name, email, birthday, gender, etc. of the user. The 2nd class contains information about the product that the user ordered, such as: name, category of the item, price, number of units available and information about the user's discount.
